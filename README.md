This site is made for my degreeproject in Front End developer-class FED21D
I set up 3 sprints, and managed to work with them like I planned: 

First 2 weeks I took lots of photos, made a moodboard, wireframes of how I wanted every side to look, decided wich font I should use and so on. For ex I used Times New Roman for all texts because it is easy for the user to read. 
I knew from the beginning that it should be a homepage with colors, because that´s "me". 

In week 3 I started to set up everything in Wordpress, downloaded elementor and other plugins I wanted for the project. Then I wanted to dig deeper in Elementor, and I spent much time to watch tutorials and read documentations. This was a part I had not thought would take this much time, but I wanted to go deep and really learn how to use it. I learned a lot about it, and I think this was a bonus of this project, something I had not count in.
I also started to make some code in VSC. I wrote all the texts, put up some css and also I wanted to make a contactform with JS.

I have to say I used really basic and just a few lines of the code in my page. I understand how to do it, but Elementor is really easy to use and I choosed to use it more than my own code. 

unfortunatelly the JS file got broken, and I had to put in a standard contact-form from Elementor, to work as long as I check my JS-code and finds out where it is broken and why. (I alaready have some idéas, but it will take some time, and I will have to handle this work in)

When the page was almost done I let 3 different persons to use it. I asked them to navigate to different pages, and give theirs oppihion of it. 

I also checked that the page is responsive into tablet and mobile.

Then in week 4 I made the "final touch", and had the presentation of my work. (and ripped my hair of because of the JS-file, but decided it is better to take a break from it, make an easy solution and go on with the problem later on). 

My reflection of this work:
It was really fun and  I learnt a lot, about WP, Elementor and my self too. One thing I have discovered thru this course is that I am more like a creator than a developer. I like design more than code, and will go on into the UX/UI-world.
